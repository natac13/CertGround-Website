**AWS CloudFront**
Amazon CloudFront is a web service of Amazon Web Services, Inc., P.O. Box 81226, Seattle, WA 98108-1226, http://aws.amazon.com (“CloudFront”) that speeds up distribution of static and dynamic web content such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to users. CloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that is being served with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

• If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.

• If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket (where we have hosted our assets for the website) or an HTTP server (in our case, our production web servers in Rackspace) that has been identified as the source for the definitive version of the content.

CloudFront captures information about each request that includes system logs which captures the following information: IP address, lat/long of the server which served the request, country and date and time. More information about AWS's privacy practices can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/.
