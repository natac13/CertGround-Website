## Overview

The Class Calendar will show colored Class events on a per months view basis. For Admins, up to 6 months previous and 6 months in advance of the current date.

Above the calendar there are options to go to previous month, refresh the calendar, go to today, and advance to the next month. You will also see what month you are currently on.

With desktop view there are also arrow buttons on the sides of the calendar to change the month shown.

By selecting a Class event you will be taken to that [Class Detail Page][ClassDetails].

:::tip
To find Classes outside the 6 month window either way, please use the [Class Search][ClassSearch] option.
