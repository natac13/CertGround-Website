### Seats

Seats is how many members can be trained at once with each Class. Seats will default to the number of [Spots](../course/details#spot) set when [creating the Course](../course/create#page-2).
Admins can change the default value when [creating the Class](./create#page-2), and after the Class has been created

The Seats limit will determine when Members are added to the [Waiting List][WaitingList].

### Trainer

The Trainer field is optional when [creating a Class](./create#page-2). This is for your records, and a blank Trainer field will **not** prevent an admin from [Completing a Class](#complete-the-class).

### Registration Closed

Deleting a Class should only be done for Classes that have not yet happened.

:::caution
Classes cannot be deleted until all members have been [Unregistered][AdminUnregister] and removed from the [Waiting List][WaitingList].
